Thank you for your passion and support for our team. We couldn’t do what we do without fans like you standing with us.</p><p class=\"agenda\">At the start of the season, we talked about the need for change. We brought on John Tortorella as head coach, and Torts has set off a shift in culture and character that has had immediate and positive impact on our team. We vow to bring this heart, hustle, and accountability to every game.</p><p class=\"agenda\">As the calendar draws to a close, we’re looking forward to some big events in 2014: The Tim Horton’s NHL Heritage Classic&#8482; a special Olympic Tribute; and Henrik Sedin’s 1000th game. We’re also gearing up, of course, for the Stanley Cup Playoffs.</p><p class=\"agenda\">On behalf of everyone at Canucks Sports &amp; Entertainment, we wish you a safe and happy holiday season! See you at Rogers Arena in 2014.</p><p class=\"agenda\">Sincerely,</p><img src=\"images/shared/signature.gif\"><p class=\"agenda\"><strong class=\"agendab\">Michael D.
